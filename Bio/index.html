  <p style="font-size: 20px;" id="bio" class="green">My name is Terri Woods I retired from the United States Air Force after 25.5 years. <strong>I spent my whole career working in various orthopedic clinics.</strong> When I orignally joined the air force I wanted to be an air traffic controller. <b>Unfortunately, that did not work out for me, due to having almost no depth perception and really bad vision, that dream was cut short.</b>  Fortunately for me, I had a great counselor, and he reserved a position for me as a surgical technician. After graduating basic training, I went to tech school to learn my craft. I graduated tech school and went to my first base where I was notified that my job had changed from surgical technician to orthopedics. That was the begining of a long successful career.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"id="bio" class="green">As an orthopedic technican in the AF, I got the opportunity to travel a lot. <i>Over the last 25.5 years, I have moved 5 times and deployed overseas 3 times.</i>  My first time overseas was I had the opportunity to work with United Nations, US Navy, Marines and Army in a Joint Humanitarian Task Force in Haiti . <em>This is where I discovered that I really had a passion for helping people and volunteering. </em>This passion for helping people in my community had remained to this day. I am currently attached to several non-profits, that I was introduced to during my enlistment.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">My hobbies include working with senior citizens, veterens and young adults. The various organizations that I am involved with allow me to maintain my hobbies. <small>After I retired,</small> <mark>I decided to get out of my comfort zone,</mark> and start working with animals. I am the go to dog sitter amongst my friends.  I would like to expand on this by becoming a foster parent to small animals.<del> This will happen within the next year or two.</del> In my spare time, <sup>2</sup>I like to read and walk around my neighborhood, when the weather is good. <sub>see note</sub></p>
